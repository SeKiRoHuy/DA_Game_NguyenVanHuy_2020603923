# 2D-Game-Platformer-Personal-Project
WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a learning project where I am developing a 2D platformer and action-adventure game inspired by *Hollow Knight*, built using Unity. The project serves as a hands-on experience to explore game development concepts such as level design, AI behavior, and sprite integration, animation and more.

The game is currently in development, and this repository contains the project files and assets.
